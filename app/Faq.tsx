                As tempting as it is to weave them into artistic sculptures,
                those cables are essential for connecting, charging, and beaming

                It&apos;s recommended to keep your software up to date to ensure

              <AccordionContent>
                Devices can generate heat during operation, especially when
                running intensive tasks. This is normal, but if it gets too hot,
                it may indicate a problem.
